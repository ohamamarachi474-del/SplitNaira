# Issue #420 — Mainnet Launch: Wave 5 (Backend) Implementation Plan

Objective
---------
Deliver a high-impact backend workstream for Mainnet Launch Wave 5 to accelerate deployment readiness for SplitNaira.

Scope
-----
- Audit current backend implementation for gaps impacting mainnet readiness.
- Implement production-grade improvements tied to Mainnet Launch (security, observability, retries, rate-limits).
- Add/adjust tests and CI checks.
- Update operational docs and runbooks with rollback guidance.

Acceptance Criteria
-------------------
- Clear implementation plan included in the PR description (this file).
- Code changes merged with tests passing in CI.
- README, docs/, and runbooks updated for operational readiness.
- Operational impact and rollback notes documented.

Planned Workstreams
-------------------
1. Audit & Quick Wins
   - Review middlewares (rate-limit, request-id, validate) and error handling.
   - Harden configuration loading for production (env.ts/env.test.ts paths).
   - Add stricter validation and response validation where missing.

2. Observability & Reliability
   - Ensure structured logging, request tracing, and sufficient metrics.
   - Add retry/backoff patterns for RPCs to external services.
   - Ensure DB connection pool settings are production-safe.

3. Security & Access
   - Review project-access middleware and auth gaps.
   - Ensure secrets/config not logged and rotate-friendly.

4. Tests & CI
   - Add/adjust unit and e2e tests to cover critical flows (transactions, splits, users).
   - Add CI checks for linting, type-checking, and tests.

5. Docs & Runbooks
   - Update README.md with deployment checklist.
   - Add runbook with rollback steps and operational-impact notes.

Implementation Checklist (to be included in PR description)
---------------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Implementation plan added (this file)
- [ ] Changes are covered by unit and/or e2e tests
- [ ] CI passes (lint, typecheck, tests)
- [ ] README and docs updated
- [ ] Runbook updated with rollback steps
- [ ] Operational impact summary included in PR

PR Description Template
-----------------------
Summary:

- What: Briefly list the substantive code changes.
- Why: Risk/benefit and relation to Mainnet Launch Wave 5.
- Risk: Brief summary of deployment risk and rollback steps.

Acceptance Criteria Mapping:

- Link to this plan file and checklist.

Operational Notes (short)
-------------------------
- Expected DB migrations (if any): list files and safe migration strategy.
- Rollback plan: revert commit(s), redeploy previous image, and restore DB in case of destructive migrations.
- Monitoring: dashboard and alerting changes to watch post-deploy.

Next Steps
----------
1. Split the work into smaller PRs (prefer multiple focused PRs: one for config/hardening, one for observability, one for tests, etc.).
2. Implement the first focused PR (config + middleware hardening) on this branch.
3. Iterate on tests and docs, then open the final PR for merging.

Maintainer Notes
----------------
Please review the plan and suggest ordering or additional operational checks.
